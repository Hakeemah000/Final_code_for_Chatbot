## Final code for making a chatbot with the addition of a code to convert from voice to text
###

Here I will put the complete code for making a chatbot that I had put on my home page for the code. First, it was converting the voice to text, second, linking it to the API, and now converting from text to voice.

## Languages ​​used

- HTML language to create the structure.
- CSS language for organization and decoration.
- JavaScript language for writing commands.
## Some important information

###

- The API key must be active and correct.

- You must know what the URL is for any model you will use, i.e. model 4 or 3 and so on, because the links differ from each other.

- You must run localhost so that your code works correctly (this is one of the mistakes I faced).

- There are problems related to CORS and can be solved in several ways. The method I tried, I learned from here [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), but it did not work for me, but it is possible to work for someone else.
## Note

It is possible that what I will put will annoy some people in terms of form, but I will put the complete code so that if I happen to have some errors, someone will inform me of them, and it is also possible that I have helped someone solve something.
